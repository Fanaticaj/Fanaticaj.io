# About Me

I’m **Anthony Grippi** — a recent Computer Science graduate with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I enjoy exploring how systems break so I can build them better, and I thrive in environments that challenge both my technical skills and creativity.

Outside of development, I value learning, mentorship, and meaningful collaboration. I'm deeply curious about the intersection of technology, security, and public impact—often thinking about how systems shape human behavior.

On the technical side, I’ve spent years sharpening my backend skills, and recently I’ve gravitated toward the security side of software engineering—where architecture meets adversarial thinking. I’ve explored areas like authentication systems, network security, and application hardening, and I’ve built practical experience using tools such as **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, and **Wireshark**. Whether I’m securing API integrations, working with **OAuth 2.0**, or analyzing system vulnerabilities in a home lab, I’m driven by a desire to build systems that are not just functional—but **resilient**, **trustworthy**, and **secure by design**.

Professionally, I serve as a **Senior Developer and Architect** at **Clarus IT Solutions**, where I lead cross-functional teams on CRM and automation projects—integrating platforms like **Microsoft Dynamics 365** and **Power Platform**. I take pride in architecting secure, scalable systems for enterprise clients across various industries, often bridging legacy tech with modern cloud-first solutions.

I'm a **security enthusiast** at heart, actively pursuing a transition into **penetration testing**. I’ve built a personal home lab, studied **OWASP vulnerabilities**, and completed coursework in **cryptography**, **intrusion detection systems**, and **secure system design**. My hands-on experience spans tools like **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, and **Nmap**, with recent projects exploring **OAuth 2.0**, **custom connectors**, and **API security** in production environments.

Outside of academics and professional work, I’m a lifelong learner who enjoys building **automation tools**, experimenting with **AI**, and tackling creative side projects—from crafting games with reinforcement learning to building integrations between platforms like **Jira** and **Dataverse**. Whether it's optimizing business workflows or writing clean, expressive code, I’m always driven by **curiosity**, **craftsmanship**, and the pursuit of **elegant problem-solving**.
